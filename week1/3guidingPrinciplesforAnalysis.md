# Guiding Principles for Analysis of Algorithms

1. Use "Worst Case" analysis

Make absolutely no assumptions about the input.

"Average Case" and "Benchmark" analysis require domain specific knowledge but can be useful for practical applications.

2. Do not worry (too much) about constant factors or lower-order terms

Simpler and sloppy upward bounds for easier mathematics

Constants depend on machines and there is no reason to track those small changes

3. Asymptotic Analysis

Focus on large input sizes (N)

"Only big problems are interesting"

A *Fast Algorithm* ðŸ”¥ === <mark>worst-case running time grows slowly with input size</mark> (Good Asymptotic running time)

Aim for **mathematical** tactility and **predictive power**

Aspire to linear running time
